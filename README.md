# Datavity 
Datavity is a language about Feature Engineering, focusing more on the first steps in FE, which is handling missing data from a dataset 
& applying different feature scaling methods. All of this is for making the features more acceptable to the AI model for a better 
prediction and less error. This language also applies Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), which calculates how far is the predicted value to 
the real value. The goal is to minize the RMSE by doing Feature Engineering
